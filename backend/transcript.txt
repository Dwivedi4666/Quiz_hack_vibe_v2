Welcome back to our journey with
0:03
Typescript. Throughout this series, we
0:06
have learned many powerful TypeScript
0:08
concepts. Variables and type
0:10
definitions. How TypeScript ensures type
0:13
safety. Type interfaces and annotations.
0:17
When to let Typescript guess when to be
0:19
explicit.
0:21
Interfaces versus type aliases. Defining
0:24
object shapes and relationships.
0:26
Function signatures. Typing inputs and
0:29
outputs. Generics. Creating reusable
0:32
type- safe components.
0:35
Advanced types that are unions,
0:37
intersections, map types, and
0:39
conditionals. Decorators attaching
0:42
behaviors to classes, methods, and
0:45
properties. Null safety handling null
0:48
and undefined gracefully. Let's see how
0:51
real world projects bring all these
0:53
concepts together. Imagine you are a
0:55
software engineer tasked with building a
0:58
simple blog management system and we
1:00
have been specified with these
1:02
requirements.
1:03
Create, read, update and delete blog
1:06
post. User management with different
1:09
roles. Admin, editor, viewer. Tags and
1:13
categories for organizing posts.
1:16
Comments on posts with moderation.
1:19
Access control. Not everyone can edit
1:22
every post. So let's begin. Yeah. So let
1:26
us just create a file. Uh let's name
1:29
this as blog.ts.
1:34
Yeah.
1:35
Let's start with the first one that is
1:38
uh we have type definitions
1:42
and interfaces.
1:44
Let's define the interface for student.
1:48
A student will have ID which is of type
1:51
number. Then name, age is uh let's not
1:55
put optional over here.
1:59
They will have an email which is of
2:01
string.
2:07
They will have a role number
2:09
which is a mandatory field and they will
2:13
have grades which is also a number. It's
2:16
an array. Let's check the next one which
2:19
is type aliases.
2:23
Here let's define a student input type
2:31
which will be
2:33
omit
2:38
student
2:46
or the grids.
2:50
Yeah.
2:53
Let's define another one which is our
2:57
grade response
2:59
which will be uh having a success which
3:03
is of type boolean
3:06
and it will have the data which can be
3:09
optional of type number. It will have an
3:13
error optional which is of type string.
3:18
Okay, let's see enums now. So, enums
3:23
will have a enum for the letter grade
3:31
A B. Yeah. Okay.
3:34
Uh
3:36
we'll have enum for student status.
3:43
Student status
3:48
active inactive. Yeah.
3:55
Okay.
3:58
We'll uh also define the union time st.
4:04
So this is of type
4:08
course result which is of type either
4:11
student or it is null
4:16
type uh let's add for validation of
4:19
result validation of result. So this is
4:22
either true or it's a string.
4:27
Okay,
4:32
let's add decorators. Now,
4:39
let's add this function log method which
4:42
will have a target method name. Uh
4:45
instead of method name, let's put it as
4:48
property key.
4:50
property key and descriptor, which is
4:53
property descriptor.
4:55
Yeah, you this
4:58
original method is the descriptor value.
5:06
We will have this dot
5:10
value which is a function
5:17
ask
5:18
any an array.
5:23
I missed one.
5:28
Okay,
5:30
we'll do a console.log over here.
5:34
Same method list. Yeah,
5:38
third property key with arguments. We
5:42
want JSON signify
5:44
with R. Okay.
5:55
original this. Yeah,
6:02
add a similar one. Let me just copy this
6:08
to validate the input.
6:12
Validate
6:13
input. This will have target property
6:16
key and property description. original
6:18
will be descriptor value. Uh here also
6:21
it's the same. Yeah, here we check if
6:27
my arguments zero
6:32
is not there
6:34
then I need to throw a new error.
6:38
Throw new error invalid input.
6:45
Yeah. And I'll return this original
6:47
value. Yeah, let's define the abstract
6:50
classes now.
6:54
Abstract class.
6:58
So abract
7:02
person it will have
7:09
abstract
7:11
details
7:13
which is of type string.
7:17
We will have protected
7:20
format name
7:25
of string.
7:28
It will return string over here.
7:36
add name dot character at the first
7:40
position dot to upper case
7:44
dot slice dot to lower case. Yeah, we'll
7:48
do this. Okay,
7:51
now we'll see classes with excess
7:53
modifiers.
7:55
So we'll see classes with
7:59
excess modifiers.
8:02
So that is uh we see class student grade
8:11
student
8:13
grade manager.
8:16
It will extend
8:18
person.
8:22
It will say private students.
8:30
It will map
8:34
number
8:35
against the student.
8:38
Uh let's define as new map.
8:46
I define a protected department over
8:48
here.
9:07
I will have a school name.
9:17
Let's add a generate method now.
9:24
This should be public
9:35
t will be an array and it will return
9:45
correction and item. Yes.
9:48
Let's add
9:51
conditional
9:53
app button.
10:04
We'll use this.
10:07
This will have object
10:12
type and key is
10:17
T of T
10:20
extend
10:29
key of Hey,
11:18
Okay. Now let's add validate input
11:23
also log method.
11:28
Let's add a student over here.
11:31
Add student
11:33
input will be the student uh data which
11:36
is student input.
11:39
Let's close this method.
11:44
Let's say constant student
11:53
ID is
11:55
start
11:57
next ID
11:59
++
12:04
is input
12:06
grade is this
12:09
get student ID and it will return the
12:11
student. Yeah, I'll close this. Yes,
12:22
let's add another method. So, this will
12:24
have my log method.
12:29
This will be add grade.
12:35
Uh, this will have the student ID and a
12:38
grade which will be a grade response.
12:42
If my
12:44
grade is below zero
12:48
or
12:49
grade is greater than 100,
12:53
I will
12:55
return
12:58
success is false and grade must be
13:00
between this.
13:02
Let me yeah
13:05
constant student.
13:08
Let me get the student.
13:11
Uh we'll put the check over here.
13:15
We'll do student grade push and return
13:17
successful data whatever is the grade.
13:20
Yeah. Let's add another method with the
13:24
log method.
13:28
We'll do get student
13:32
fetch the GP.
13:38
So that is the student ID the grade
13:41
response over here.
13:54
It will fetch the student.
14:00
If not student then return the error
14:04
that student is not found.
14:09
If yeah then return it no grades
14:12
available.
14:14
Let's calculate the GPA that is
14:20
GPA =
14:22
student
14:27
reduce.
14:43
Yeah. And we'll return this.
14:48
We'll do data. We'll do
15:02
100ide by 100.
15:08
Yeah,
15:11
this is for getting the GPA. Now
15:14
let's write for the letter grade.
15:18
This will be a function with union
15:21
written type
15:24
return.
15:37
which is number
15:42
it will be letter grade or null
15:45
or uh we can say invalid also
15:56
we'll say if it is this if it is above
16:00
90 then it's a yeah else it is invalid
16:05
Let's get the student email now.
16:22
Here we will use
16:26
student uh mail
16:32
or it is
16:36
Yeah, we'll do this constant student is
16:38
yeah okay not student it will return
16:40
null else it will return student do
16:43
email al so let's write a function to
16:46
get all the students
16:54
which is read only
16:57
student array
17:04
It will return
17:08
object
17:12
screens array.
17:31
We'll write a function to calculate the
17:33
average CGPA
17:36
which will be private function.
18:13
I will traverse through the students
18:15
arena.
18:22
student do grades dot length is greater
18:27
than zero
18:33
then constant GPA is this
18:36
and GPS dot push is this
18:40
we'll also do this yeah return map draw
18:44
this
18:48
Okay.
18:51
Uh we'll also add a override to get the
18:54
details.
19:06
Okay.
19:08
I'll display the students now.
19:20
say console.log vlog
19:25
student list.
19:28
Uh this dot students
19:34
students do for each student will
19:37
display this
19:43
and grades. Yeah. Uh we'll just show ID,
19:46
name, and we won't show email. Show role
19:50
number.
19:52
Yeah, ID, name, and grid. Okay, we'll
19:55
close this over here.
20:00
We'll display the statistics.
20:12
That's display the statistics. So
20:17
we'll have this statistics dot this dot
20:20
get statistics.
20:25
Okay. Yeah. We'll also add the get
20:28
statistics method. We'll add it over
20:31
here.
20:34
Type record. Yeah. Okay. Now let me have
20:37
my main function
20:40
which will have all my student data
20:42
basically.
20:43
So yeah I have some data over here of
20:47
students. So I'm calling my student
20:50
grade manager over here. I'm adding a
20:53
student to this
20:56
and I'm doing the console log over here.
20:59
And let me also call my main function
21:01
now.
21:06
Let me do
21:08
Yes.
21:11
Yes.
21:14
I have to also
21:17
do one more change in DS config.
21:20
Uh I have to put that experimental
21:22
decorator as true.
21:28
In my ts config I had to set uh this
21:31
thing the target as uh es16 over here.
21:35
Then this force consistent casing in
21:38
file name I have to set it as true. Uh
21:41
and for that for using decorators I have
21:43
to set this experimental decorators as
21:46
true over here. Yeah. And uh this is the
21:49
file that we have created. Let me just
21:52
run this now.
21:54
Yeah. As you can see um the output. So
21:59
it shows us all the students.
22:03
Um yeah it shows us the student grade
22:06
management. This console it says adding
22:09
these students over here.
22:12
So these students are added. Then it
22:14
shows us adding grades. So these grades
22:16
are added for the students. Then it
22:19
shows us the students. So with the ID,
22:22
the name and the grades.
22:25
Then we called a GPA function and it
22:29
shows us the GPA with arguments this.
22:31
And it shows us that student one has
22:33
scored 91, student two has scored 80.
22:37
Then it shows us the letter grades also
22:39
that it is 95%. So A, then 78 is C and
22:43
65 is D. Then it shows us student one
22:46
email is this. testing null safety is
22:50
student not found. So there is a student
22:52
who is not found over here. Then we have
22:54
the statistics. So there are total three
22:56
students. Uh the grades total are six
22:59
since each student has two grades and
23:02
the average GPA was this 79.83
23:05
and system info is uh the department
23:08
which is engineering and uh school name
23:11
that is tech academy. And yeah this is
23:13
the end. That's it. You have now seen
23:15
how every TypeScript concept works
23:18
together in a real world application.
23:20
You can see a snapshot on the screen
23:22
that shows how we used all Typescript
23:25
concepts in building the blog system.
23:27
Same principles scale to million line
23:29
code bases. You now understand
23:32
TypeScript deeply. We will learn more
23:34
about MS stack in the upcoming classes.
23:36
Until then, keep coding, keep exploring.
23:39
Thank you.
